#How backend will work:

1. Form is created with each question. Question consists of text, type, and the available options.
- There are two types, "multiple" and "boolean". 
- Options are of user's choice for multiple and for boolean it is just "True" or "False" (for clarity, will remove), which will be translated to 0 and 1 for CSV.
